echo "üîß Testing WebRTC Room Connection Fix"
echo "=====================================\n"

echo "‚úÖ Changes applied:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Added currentRoomRef for reliable room state tracking"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Updated all WebRTC signaling to use currentRoomRef.current"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Added better error logging with room state information"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Synchronized room state between React state and server\n"

echo "üß™ Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Open: http://localhost:3000/call"
echo "2. Enter a room ID (e.g., 'test-room')"
echo "3. Click 'Join Room' - should see 'Status: in-room'"
echo "4. Open second browser tab with same URL"
echo "5. Enter SAME room ID and join"
echo "6. Video call should start automatically without 'Not in the specified room' error"
echo "7. Check browser console for detailed logging\n"

echo "üêõ If you still see errors:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Check browser console for the new debug logs"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Look for 'Current room state' messages"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Verify both users joined the same room ID"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Make sure signaling server (port 4000) is running\n"

echo "üìä Server Status:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Signaling Server: http://localhost:4000"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Next.js App: http://localhost:3000" 
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Call Interface: http://localhost:3000/call"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Health Check: http://localhost:4000/health\n"

echo "‚ú® The fix should resolve the 'Not in the specified room' error!"
echo "   Happy testing! üéâ"
