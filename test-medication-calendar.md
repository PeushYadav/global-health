# Medication Calendar Integration Test

## What was implemented:

### 1. TodayMedsCard Integration
- Added `medicationTaken` event dispatch when "Take Now" is clicked
- Event is triggered after successful API call to `/api/patient/medication/take`

### 2. CalendarCard Integration
- Added listener for `medicationTaken` events
- Calendar refreshes automatically when medications are taken
- Shows medication activity with blue squares

### 3. API Consistency Fix
- Fixed date format mismatch between APIs
- All APIs now use `ymdLocal()` from `@/utils/date` for consistent timezone handling
- Fixed cookies usage in Next.js 15 (await cookies())

### 4. Calendar Legend
- Green: Login activity only
- Blue: Medication taken only  
- Emerald: Both login and medication
- Black ring: Appointments

## Testing Flow:

1. **Login to patient dashboard**
2. **Go to medication card and click "Take Now"**
3. **Calendar should immediately show today's square as blue (medication taken)**
4. **If also logged in today, square should be emerald (both activities)**

## APIs Updated:

- `/api/patient/medication/take` - Now uses `ymdLocal()` and dispatches events
- `/api/patient/medication/today` - Now uses `ymdLocal()` for consistency  
- `/api/patient/daily-logs` - Fixed cookies and improved medication detection

## Real-time Updates:

- **Medication card**: Updates immediately when "Take Now" clicked
- **Calendar**: Updates immediately via custom events
- **Progress indicator**: Shows "X of Y taken" in real-time

The system now provides seamless integration between medication tracking and calendar visualization!
