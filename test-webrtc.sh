# WebRTC Video Calling App - Test Script
# This script demonstrates how to test the complete video calling functionality

echo "üöÄ WebRTC Video Calling App - Test Guide"
echo "========================================"
echo

echo "üìã Prerequisites Check:"
echo "‚úÖ Signaling Server running on http://localhost:4000"
echo "‚úÖ Next.js App running on http://localhost:3001"
echo "‚úÖ Socket.IO client installed"
echo

echo "üß™ Testing Instructions:"
echo

echo "1. BASIC CONNECTIVITY TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Open: http://localhost:4000/health"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Should show server status with 0 active rooms"
echo

echo "2. VIDEO CALL INTERFACE TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Open: http://localhost:3001/call"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Should show 'Status: connected' at the top"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Should display your local video stream"
echo

echo "3. SINGLE USER ROOM TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Enter room ID: 'test123'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Click 'Join Room'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Status should change to 'Status: in-room'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Should see 'Waiting for other participant...'"
echo

echo "4. TWO-USER VIDEO CALL TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Open a second browser tab/window"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/call"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Enter the same room ID: 'test123'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Click 'Join Room'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Both users should see each other's video"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Status should show 'Status: call-active'"
echo

echo "5. CHAT FUNCTIONALITY TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Type a message in the chat box"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Click 'Send' or press Enter"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Message should appear in both users' chat"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Look for üü¢ Direct (DataChannel) or üî¥ Server (Socket.IO)"
echo

echo "6. MEDIA CONTROLS TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Click 'üìπ Video On/Off' to toggle video"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Click 'üé§ Audio On/Off' to toggle audio"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Changes should be visible to the other user"
echo

echo "7. CONNECTION CLEANUP TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Close one browser tab"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Other user should see video disappear"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Status should return to 'in-room'"
echo

echo "üìä Debug Information:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Scroll to bottom of call page for debug panel"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Shows connection states and troubleshooting info"
echo

echo "üõ†Ô∏è  Troubleshooting:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ If camera/mic not working: Check browser permissions"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ If connection fails: Check browser console for errors"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ If no video: Try different browsers (Chrome recommended)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ If chat not working: Check DataChannel state in debug panel"
echo

echo "üåê Browser Compatibility:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Chrome (Recommended)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Firefox"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Safari"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Edge"
echo

echo "üîí Security Notes:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Camera/mic access requires user permission"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ HTTPS required for production deployment"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ WebRTC works peer-to-peer (no video data through server)"
echo

echo "üéØ Success Criteria:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Two users can see each other's video"
echo "   ‚úÖ Audio communication works both ways"  
echo "   ‚úÖ Text chat messages appear in real-time"
echo "   ‚úÖ Media controls (video/audio toggle) work"
echo "   ‚úÖ Users can join/leave rooms cleanly"
echo

echo "üìù Next Steps:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Test with different room IDs"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Try screen sharing (extend the code)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Test on different devices/networks"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Deploy to production with HTTPS"

echo "Happy testing! üéâ"
